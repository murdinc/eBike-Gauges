eBike-Gauges
============

An Arduino sketch for the gauges on the electric bicycle I am building. 

This project utilizes 2 i2c OLED displays, a UBLOX GPS unit, and an accelerometer. Speed, time, date and direction are gathered using GPS, and the angle of the bicycle is displayed "in 3D" from the accelerometer readings.
